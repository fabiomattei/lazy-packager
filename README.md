# lazy-packager
A packager for wordpress plugins, themes and more.

A packager for lazy people.

## The problem
Packaging plugins and themes for wordpress is so boring.

You need to keep out of the packages all working script and all working directories like sass files, partial scripts and more.
It would be so nice if we could be able to define a plugin with all the list of directories that need to be incluted once and then press a _build_ button anytime we need to build the package for distribution.
And it would be so nice if we could do that in a easy to use interface.

This is what lazy packages is for.
